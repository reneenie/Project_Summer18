/*To solve the problem: the client is using 12 four-point Likert scale items to do cluster.*/
/*Each item is labeled with one of the five stage in the adoption curve in her field. Thus, the five labels are ordered.*/
/*The final goal is to categorize respondents to these five categories. Fewer categories are acceptable.*/

*First approach: use the original 12 items;
