/*To solve the problem: the client is using 12 four-point Likert scale items to do cluster.*/
/*Each item is labeled with one of the five stage in the adoption curve in her field. Thus, the five labels are ordered.*/
/*The final goal is to categorize respondents to these five categories. Fewer categories are acceptable.*/

*First approach: use the original 12 items;

/*Import data*/
proc import datafile="W:\\pu.data\Desktop\sas.stat.computer\data17195.csv"
out=WORK.adp1;run;
proc print data=WORK.adp1;run;

/*Before we get into the PCA analysis, we need to first fixed our reversed items*/
data WORK.adp;
set WORK.adp1;
First_person=5-First_person;run;

/*PCA using all 12 items*/

/*Step 1: we need to check how significant is the first component*/
proc factor
data=WORK.adp
method=prin  /*specifies the method to be used in extracting components.*/
priors=one /*specify PRIORS=one to perform a principal component analysis*/
mineigen=1 /*This statement will cause PROC FACTOR to retain and rotate any component whose eigenvalue is 1.00 or larger.*/
plots=scree /*perform a scree test to visually determine how many components should be retained*/
rotate=varimax /*varimax rotation provides orthogonal (uncorrelated) components.*/
simple /*simple descriptive statistics*/
flag=.40  /*flag (with an asterisk) factor loadings with absolute values greater than some specified size.*/ ;
var Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q5 Q6 Q7 Q8 Q9 Q11 Q12;
run;
/*We want to see, in the results, that factor 1 has a significantly higher eigenvalue than other factors*/

/*Step 2: Calculate the optimal weights using PCA by specifying factor number to be 1*/
proc factor
data=WORK.adp
nfact=1
method=prin  /*specifies the method to be used in extracting components.*/
rotate=varimax /*varimax rotation provides orthogonal (uncorrelated) components.*/

score
out=adpscore;
var Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q5 Q6 Q7 Q8 Q9 Q11 Q12;run;
proc print data=adpscore;
run;
*The output data will automatically give you each observation's score for factor 1. You can use this score as a criteria;

*The next step is to look at the distribution of the scores for factor 1 to help you decide how to categorize the respondents into different adoption stages;
